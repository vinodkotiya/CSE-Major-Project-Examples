Dear Parents,

It was a great pleasure to welcome our tiny tots in the session 2002-2003. Now they are well adjusted to their class routine and enjoying their learning through a variety of activities in their classroom and outside.

As we all know parents play a key role in the process of teaching and learning, so time-to-time interaction and communication with the teachers is very essential for the overall development of young children.

Therefore P.T.M. will be held on the last Saturday of every month.

So, we request you to please attend the P.T.M as mentioned.
