Space Defender is a classical arcade style action game.
It's a cool 2D space game with scrolling backgrounds, stars, alien spacecrafts,
asteroids and background music.

You are in control of a fighter that can move across the screen, dodging enemy fire 
and mowing down wave after wave of bad aliens (it looks like Raptor or Demonstar).

This program uses the basic idea of  the code 'Return of the Avenger' developed by Tanner Helland 
and applies some modifications inspired by various examples I' ve found in Planet Source Code
(see the code names and their authors in the Credits) and just a bit of mine.  

So don't vote for me or do it if you like but, please, take a look at the original works 
and let the authors know they did a great job too!

I would like to thank all programmers which let me download all their sample code
(this was a great help for me) and a special thank to Planet Source Code (I' ve found some 
very useful info there).

I wrote this code in my spare time only for fun and to improve my knowledge of Visual Basic.
Well, there are still some little bugs and a lot of work to do: there aren't setting menu control,
upgrades, sound effects, terrean units and rotating spaceships yet (I' am working at them), but
I think it's enough to have a good play.

Space Defender is written in Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 and it run utilizing some Windows API
(no DirectX here);
graphics are my own variations of MKS's Demonstar 3.21 shareware version artworks, realized using 
Paint Shop Pro 5 and Adobe Photoshop 5.0.

The files of background music were found in the net (I don't remember where,sorry).
The program changes the screen resolution, then restores it at the end of the game with 32 bit
colors: if your pc does not support it, change it in then ScreenRes Module.
The game has been tested on my Pentium MMX 166 Mhz with Windows 95 and on my brother's 
Pentium III 400 Mhz with Windows 98.
On Windows NT sometimes the CreateCompatibleDC gives problems on creating the Device Context. 

Now the missions are only two but you can free your fantasy and add custom missions and/or 
graphics plugins, levels, sound effects and music, modify the code or employ parts of it within
your own projects.
Only one restriction: nobody must use any part of this program in commercial purposes.

Send your homemade extensions or modifications of this program in Planet Source Code, so everyone
will upgrade own copy.

Send your game to friends, and have fun with it.
Feel encouraged to spread the program around the net.  

Look for my extensions on this site, they will soon.

Happy coding and have fun!

Space Defender Gameplay
-----------------------

Controlling Space Defender is extremely simple.
There are just buttons for movement and the fire button: 

UP = Press the Up arrow key on your keyboard to move your fighter upwards in the game.    
DOWN = Press the Down arrow key on your keyboard to move your fighter downwards in the game.
LEFT = Press the Left arrow key on your keyboard to move your fighter left in the game.
RIGHT = Press the Right arrow key on your keyboard to move your fighter right in the game.
FIRE = Press the Ctrl key on your keyboard to fire your fighter weapons in the game.

PAUSE = Press the Pause key to pause the game (the Alphablending.dll must be in your system directory).
EXIT = Press the Escape key on your keyboard to quit Space Defender during the game.


Space Defender is played with two goals in mind: to complete the level you are playing and to achieve a score as high as possible shooting as many enemy ships as you can while them continue to steam in from the upper screen border.
 
During each level, when adding 1500 point at your score standings an extra life will awarded
to you.

To pass from one level to another you have to complete it defeating the Boss.  

Enjoy!

Bye!
