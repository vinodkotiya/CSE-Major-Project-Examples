      <P ><h4 align = justify> If you wish to go on a pilgrimage or sightseeing trip to many 
      destinations, Indian Railways provides the facility of booking Circular 
      Journey Tickets. These tickets offer you unique travel flexibility, as 
      they are issued for all journeys (other than regular routes), which begin 
      and complete at the same station. Circular journey Tickets can be 
      purchased for all classes of travel. A maximum of eight break journeys 
      will be admissible on these tickets. Standard Circular Journey Tickets are 
      also offered by Zonal Railways. These cover popular destinations for the 
      Convenience of tourists. The details of route, fare etc., for these 
      tickets can be obtained from nominated stations in each Zonal Railway. You 
      can purchase these tickets if any one of the standard routes suits your 
      convenience. Otherwise you can inform the Zonal Railways about your 
      itinerary and Circular Journey Tickets can be drawn up to suit your 
      requirements.</h4></P>

       journey.</h4></P>
