<H1>RESERVATION RULES</H1>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Important - for Senior 
Citizens :-&nbsp;</B> From 1st September 2001 onwards, concession to senior 
citizens through PRS (Passenger Reservation System) shall be granted only on 
demand and not by default as at present. The demand for concession shall be made 
on Reservation Requisition form in the case of reserved tickets. In the case of 
tickets issued to senior citizens on concession, during journey the concerned 
passengers are instructed to carry some documentary proof showing their age or 
date of birth, issued by any Government&nbsp; Institution/Agency/Local Body. 
like Identity card, Driving License, Passport, Educational certificate, 
certificate from Local Bodies like Panchayat/Corporation/Municipality, or any 
other authentic and recognised document. This documentary proof of age should be 
produced if demanded by some Railway official during the journey. </P><B>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Conditions</B> :- The Railway 
Administration reserves seats, berths, compartments, or carriage in accordance 
with the rules and conditions published in the Coaching Tariff. A passenger 
seeking reservation of berth or seats should purchase tickets from the Railway 
Reservation Offices/Authorised Travel Agency only.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advance reservations are made generally up 
to 60 days in advance for all classes and all trains. The period of advance 
reservation (ARP) is exclusive of the day of departure of the train.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At intermediate stations where the train 
arrives on the following day, such reservations can be done more than 60 days in 
advance of date of journey from the intermediate station. ARP is in relation to 
the date of journey from train originating station. In case of some Inter-city 
day trains, the ARP is less.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual can book only up to six 
passengers on one requisition form provided all passengers are for the same 
destination and for the same train.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only one requisition form is accepted from a 
person at one time. However, if onward/return journey are involved, 2 or 3 forms 
can be accepted for the same passengers.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accommodation will not be reserved without 
purchase of necessary journey ticket. No reservation of accommodation will be 
made on provisional basis.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When berths are reserved for passengers, the 
intention is to provide sleeping accommodation between 9 PM to 6 AM. During 6 AM 
to 9 PM, the passengers concerned, if required make room for other passengers in 
compartment up to its carrying capacity.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passengers are requested to quote PNR number 
which is printed on each tickets on the top left hand side for any enquiry or 
complaint relating to reservations.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reservation ticket issued by the 
computerised system against pre-bought ticket must be accompanied by the journey 
tickets on train. Similarly journey cum reservation tickets bearing zero amount 
are not valid for journey unless accompanied by the valid authority to travel 
authorising issue of such tickets.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allotment of accommodation is done by the 
computer as per pre-defined logic. Efforts are made to provide compact 
accommodation to persons booked under the same PNR on first come first served 
basis.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Railway Administration will endeavour to 
provide reserved accommodation but does not guarantee the same and will admit no 
claim for compensation for inconvenience, loss or extra expense due to such 
accommodation including carriages, not being provided or reserved carriage not 
been attached to a particular train. The supply of any particular type of 
carriage or the provision of a particular berth and seat is also not 
guaranteed.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Departure time printed on the ticket is 
indicative for the guidance of the passengers. Passengers must ascertain correct 
timings from the Railway station on the day of journey. Such tickets are printed 
up to 60 days in advance. Any changes in timing after the issue of ticket can 
not be advised.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While every endeavour is made to advise 
changes in Time Table by due publicity, Railway Administration shall not be 
liable for any claim/compensation if a passenger misses a train on this 
account.</P>
<P align=justify><B>TRANSFER/RESALE OF TICKETS PROHIBITED </B>:- Under Section 
142 of the Railways ACT, journey tickets including any half of a return ticket 
and season ticket are not transferable.</P>
<P align=justify>If any person not being a Railway Servant or an agent 
authorised in this behalf :</P>

  <LI>parts or attempts to part with the possession of a ticket against which 
  reservation of a seat or a berth has been made or any half of a return ticket 
  or season ticket. He shall be punishable under the Railways Act. </LI></OL>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, if the purchaser or holder of 
transferred ticket travels or attempts to travel therewith, he shall forfeit the 
ticket which he so purchased or obtained and shall be deemed to be travelling 
without a proper ticket.</P>
<P align=justify><B>PAYMENT THROUGH CREDIT CARDS</B> :- Payment through credit 
cards for issue of reserved tickets is accepted on some nominated counters of 
computerised locations in India. In Northern Railway these counters are at IRCA, 
Reservation Office, New Delhi, Delhi Jn., Sarojini Nagar, Kirti Nagar and
