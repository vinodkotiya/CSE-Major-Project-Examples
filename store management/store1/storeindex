The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\store\Package\store.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\store\Package\Support\store.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
